# Would You Rather Project

This is the second assignment of Udacity's [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

This project implements a web application of the Game "Would you rather?". The user can log in as one of three predefined users. Then he can answer questions, create new Polls and see in a leaderboard which user has asked and answered the most questions.

The app was realized, using:

* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
* [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

## start the project

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
